# 🌌 Curious Philosophy Site

Welcome to the official repository for **CuriousPhilosophy.com** — a minimalist, work-in-progress portfolio and thought-space for exploring AI, symbolic systems, speculative metaphysics, and philosophy-driven coding.

## 📖 About the Project

This website is built as a foundational canvas to support future creative and intellectual work. Inspired by the *Refined Grit* design style, it serves as a philosophical sandbox and a digital portfolio for experimental ideas.

It’s intentionally minimal for now — built with raw HTML/CSS — and structured for ease of future editing and expansion.
